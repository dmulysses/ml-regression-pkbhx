# Machine Learning | Predicting Hydrogen-Bond Basicity

# Problem Scope
The inter- and intramolecular interactions are essential in physical, chemical, and biological properties. Within the various existing interactions, such as ionic strength and Van Der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonding (HB) strongly influences properties such as the solubility of inorganic and organic compounds, reactivity of molecules, activity of drugs, crystal packing, protein structure, and the catalytic activity of enzymes.
